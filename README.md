> [!NOTE]
> This repository is the **jcrEw Note** self-hosted edition, based on upstream
> [Many Notes v0.16.2](https://github.com/brufdev/many-notes/releases/tag/v0.16.2).
> It keeps the upstream Git history and adds image paste/drop support for Markdown notes.

## jcrEw Note customizations

- Paste screenshots or copied image files directly into the visual editor with `Ctrl + V`.
- Drag image files into either the visual editor or raw Markdown editor.
- Store new uploads under `attachments/images` beside the current note and insert the Markdown reference automatically.
- Support PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, and AVIF images.
- Provide a vault-scoped remote MCP endpoint for authorized AI clients, without document deletion tools.
- Build on the pinned upstream container while preserving the existing database and vault bind mounts.

See [image paste and storage behavior](./docs/customizations/image-paste-upload.md) for details and
[the remote MCP server guide](./docs/customizations/mcp-server.md) for AI client access, and
[the jcrEw deployment runbook](./DEPLOYMENT.jcrewnote.md) for build, deployment, backup, and rollback instructions.

### Quick deployment

Review `compose.production.yaml`, especially `APP_URL`, bind-mount paths, UID/GID, and the published
loopback port, then run:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.production.yaml build
docker compose -f compose.production.yaml up -d
docker compose -f compose.production.yaml ps
```

The included production compose file is configured for `https://jcrewnote.top`, listens only on
`127.0.0.1:8080`, and expects a reverse proxy such as Caddy to provide public HTTPS access.

Many Notes is a Markdown note-taking web application designed for simplicity! Easily create or import your vaults and organize your thoughts right away.

It uses a database to power its features, but your files are also saved in the filesystem, giving you full control over your vault structure and ensuring easy access and portability.

Vaults are simply storage containers for your files, and Many Notes lets you choose to keep all your files in one vault or organize them into separate vaults.

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> It is recommended to run Many Notes behind a reverse proxy serving the application with HTTPS. This not only secures your traffic but also gives you access to additional features like PWA support or copying to clipboard from code blocks.

## Installation

Choose your preferred method to install Many Notes:

- Docker with volumes, for a simpler installation (read below)
- Docker with bind mounts, for easy access to shared paths from the host ([read here](./docs/installation/docker-bind-mounts.md))
- Docker with a different database, if you prefer not to use SQLite ([read here](./docs/installation/docker-different-database.md))

### Docker with volumes

**Read the [upgrading guide](./UPGRADING.md) if you are upgrading from a previous version.**

Create a `compose.yaml` file with:

```yaml
services:
  php:
    image: brufdev/many-notes:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - APP_URL=http://localhost # address used to access the application
    volumes:
      - database:/var/www/html/database/sqlite
      - logs:/var/www/html/storage/logs
      - private:/var/www/html/storage/app/private
      - typesense:/var/www/html/typesense
    ports:
      - 80:8080

volumes:
  database:
  logs:
  private:
  typesense:
```

Make sure to change the address used to access the application. Feel free to change anything else if you know what you're doing, and read the customization section below before continue. Then run:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

## Customization

You can customize Many Notes by adding environment variables to the `compose.yaml` file.

### Custom URL (default: http://localhost)

If you change the default port from 80 or use a reverse proxy with a custom URL, make sure to configure the application URL accordingly. For example, if you change the port to 8080, add:

```yaml
environment:
  - APP_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### Custom timezone (default: UTC)

Check all available timezones [here](https://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php). For example, if you want to set the timezone to Amsterdam, add:

```yaml
environment:
  - APP_TIMEZONE=Europe/Amsterdam
```

### Custom upload size limit (default: 500M)

Increase the upload size limit to allow for the import of larger files. For example, if you want to increase the limit to 1 GB, add:

```yaml
environment:
  - PHP_POST_MAX_SIZE=1G
  - PHP_UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_SIZE=1G
```

### Enable OAuth providers

Many Notes supports a convenient way to authenticate with OAuth providers. Typically, these credentials may be retrieved by creating a "developer application" within the dashboard of the service you wish to use. Many Notes currently supports authentication via Authelia, Authentik, Azure, Bitbucket, Facebook, GitHub, GitLab, Google, Keycloak, LinkedIn, Pocket ID, Slack, Twitter, and Zitadel. You can enable multiple providers simultaneously by adding the corresponding environment variables.

For example, to enable GitHub OAuth, add:

```yaml
environment:
  - GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=CLIENT_ID # change id
  - GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=CLIENT_SECRET # change secret
  - GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost/oauth/github/callback # change domain and provider
```

Some providers require additional environment variables. Read the [OAuth documentation](./docs/customization/oauth.md) for more information.

### Local authentication (default: true)

Disable local authentication by configuring an OAuth provider and specifying a URL to redirect after logout. For example, to use GitHub OAuth as the only authentication method, add:

```yaml
environment:
  # enabling github provider:
  - GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=CLIENT_ID # change id
  - GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=CLIENT_SECRET # change secret
  - GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost/oauth/github/callback # change domain and provider
  # disabling local authentication:
  - GITHUB_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI=https://github.com/logout # change URL
  - SETTINGS_LOCAL_AUTH_ENABLED=false
```

### Custom email service

Configure an email service to send registration and password reset emails by adding:

```yaml
environment:
  - MAIL_MAILER=smtp
  - MAIL_HOST=127.0.0.1
  - MAIL_PORT=2525
  - MAIL_USERNAME=null
  - MAIL_PASSWORD=null
  - MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
  - MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=hello@example.com
  - MAIL_FROM_NAME="Many Notes"
```
